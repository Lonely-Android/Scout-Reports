Greetings Osiris. 
This space was weaved through the arcane to keep a log of my scouting missions until we establish a war room.
I highly reccomend that you keep this secret, and keep this safe.
Should enemies find my secure logs, our security and my methods of infiltration could be compromised.

Regards,
    L'Androd
